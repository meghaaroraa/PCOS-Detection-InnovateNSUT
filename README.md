# PCOS-Detection-InnovateNSUT

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

### OBJECTIVE

The major goal of our project is to make it possible for the women to determine for themselves whether they have a serious PCOS problem and then consult a doctor for better support. Girls and women who hesitate or are afraid to visit a doctor about PCOS-related issues may find this helpful.The discussion of these topics among women is taboo in the modern world as well. Hence, with our project, we hope to raise awareness about PCOS and encourage people to discuss their menstrual problems honestly and without embarrassment.
